# passgen
A Bash script that generates random passwords of varying lengths based on user input and includes options for generating alphanumeric or special character passwords.

Save the script to a file, such as password_generator.sh, and make it executable:

chmod +x password_generator.sh

You can then run the script and follow the prompts to specify the desired password length and whether you want to include special characters. 
The script will generate and display a random password based on your preferences.
